## What is the Epic Lead ?
We're using Pivotal Tracker in Zest. In Pivotal Tracker you can group
stories together in an Epic. Therefore Epic Lead is a person who leads
an Epic. EL role is meant to be rotated amongst different engineers,
so everyone gets a chance to try it. Everyone does it differently,
here is my experience of being in the EL role

## What the EL should do:

1. **Unblocking and moving on.** 
EL should clear up the path for Engineers and let them deliver
business features. The example of a blocker might be a mock up that
they need to  style the GUI, or a certain question about a business
logic that should be implemented. EL is a glue that puts all these
peaces of the puzzle together.

2. **Don't do it! Delegate.**
Being in engineer's shoes previously I got used to "Do it!" style of
work where you have a concrete item to work on, you have a full day of
coding and relatively a little of interrupts. But EL is interrupted
all the time, it got pulled into different meetings and therefore, as
an EL you don't really have a continuous period of time to accomplish
a given story. So what do you do? Simple, you delegate it to other
engineers and let them do it.

3. **Bring up the things that matter the most.**
There is always a room for improvement, but it's important to
concentrate on the stuff that moves us forward as a business.

## Experience
:( no fun coding

:) but more fun hacking

:( Less time for code review

:| Dealing with Humans instead of Computers

:( Continuous results

:) More blogging and presentations

:( From VIM to Gmail

## Challenges
 - Establish Working Agreements
 - Continuous Acceptance
 - Get into the rhythm Pre-IPM, IPM, Post-IMP

## You should try it
In a team of generalists, everyone who has the abilities and expresses
the desire to be the EL, should get their chance. There are some
drawbacks in changing the EL, but also fresh people can bring more
fresh ideas.
