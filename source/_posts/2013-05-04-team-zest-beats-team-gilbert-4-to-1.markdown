Team Zest gets their second win in Los Angeles Table Tennis Federation Tournament against Team Gilbert.

Lei and Brad brought 2 wins to the team in first two single games. After that Marick and Ian win a doubles match after which it was obvious that Team Zest is a winner! 4th game was a lost and Marick wins the last singles game bringing the team an extra point.

Big thanks to Jayanti and Xintong for coming to a match and supporting the team and making the awesome photos.
